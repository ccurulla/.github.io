                            <h2>How to Find Time to Read While Being a Full-Time Boss</h2>
                    
                                <p>Chances are that you've said to yourself, at least once, that you need to read more. Whether you're too busy to read a book or you just have trouble getting attached to one, we have a few tips to help you schedule in your reading so you actually get it done and enjoy it.</p>

                                <p>The main reason it's difficult to find time to read is because it's one of the few times throughout the day where you can't multitask. With something like television it's easy to get up and walk away, or pound through a few emails during commercial breaks. Reading usually requires more of your attention. Subsequently, the best way to work reading into your schedule is to find those times in the day when you can dedicate the attention needed to reading.</p>

                                <p>If you can, the easiest way to fit reading into your schedule is the most obvious: schedule in time to read. Of course, this is easier said than done, but it might be more possible than you think if you consider a few times of your day when you're not doing much else. We've talked about the benefit scheduling in 30 minutes a day to learn something new and if you can fit it into your schedule, that's all the time you need to dedicate to reading a day.</p>

                                <p>Dedicate 30 minutes a day to learn something new.</p>

                                <p>You're likely aware that 30 minutes is the recommended amount of time you're supposed to spendâ€¦ </p>

                                <p>If a 30 minute block of time is out of the question, use your downtime throughout the day to read. If you get a 15 minute break at work that you usually spend leaning against the water cooler, read instead. The same goes for you lunch, the bathroom, the gym, or even during that awkward time when you're waiting for a dinner to cook. Just make sure you always have the book you're reading with you so you can take advantage of any free time you get throughout the day. If you prefer to read a couple books at once, we've mentioned before that context is everything, so read the same book in the same location each time. 
                                </p>

                                <p> Book clubs might not seem like your thing if your only exposure to them is through Oprah, but they can be a great way to get the motivation to read. Most independent bookstores and libraries have book clubs dedicated to all types of genres and topics. The big benefit of these is that after you're done reading you'll be able to retain what you read a little better because you talk about it out loud with other people.

                                <p>If reading with strangers isn't your thing, gathering up a few friends and organizing a book club is just as useful. The key is to set deadlines for finishing a book and then meeting to discuss it. After that, it's up to you to get the reading done or suffer through a bunch of spoilers. </p> 

                                <p>Set up special reading areas with no distractions.</p>

                                <p>You can do all the scheduling, timing, and book clubs you want, but if you don't have a comfortable place to read without distractions, it's not going to do you any good. This place is different for everyone, but the idea is pretty simple. Find a place where you can get away from your phone, your family, and any other distractions and just read. This may be something like the breakroom at work where you eat lunch, or it might be a specific chair in your house, but the point is to find a place where you're comfortable and can read in peace without dealing thinking about checking your email or cleaning the house.</p>

                                <p>The idea is to create a place where you can focus and enjoy what you're doing so you can absorb what you're reading. We've shown you before the benefits of thoughtful, active reading, and a good quiet place can make the difference in your enjoyment. After all, it's probably one of the few times in your day when you don't have to try and multitask.</p>

                                </figure>
                    
                                <p>Sometimes your relationship with a book isn't working out. In that case, it's good to know when you close it up and move along to something you'll actually enjoy. As someone who often has to rely on a lot of "best of" lists to discover new books, I've tried to force myself through giant 800 page epics just because they get critical acclaim or because a friend recommended them. In those cases, I would repeatedly find excuses not to read just because I wasn't into what I was reading. Over time, I've learned to know when to back out and shelf a book for later. Read should be a pleasurable experience and if it's not, find something else to read.</p>

                                <p>It's also worth noting that finding your niche for books is probably the easiest way to make yourself take the time to read. This means something different to you than anyone else, but tracking down your favorite genres, non-fiction topics, graphic novels, or general interests is a sure-fire way to make sure you actually enjoy your time reading. If you're not sure what you like, the library is your best place to start to find the topics you're interested in. Just don't feel any shame if your favorite genre ends up being a line of steamy romance novels or cheesy hardboiled detective fiction.</p>

                                <p>Do you struggle to fit reading into your schedule? What do you do to make it happen?</p>
